# Stock Price and ASPI Prediction for the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE)

This repository contains the code and resources for our data science group project focused on predicting stock prices and the All Share Price Index (ASPI) for the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). Our approach combines technical indicators with sentiment analysis of Sinhala news articles to provide a more accurate and localized prediction model.

## Project Overview

Predicting stock market trends is a complex task, especially in emerging markets like Sri Lanka. Traditional prediction models often overlook the influence of local news and sentiment. This project addresses this gap by incorporating sentiment analysis of Sinhala news articles, which are a significant source of information for local investors. By combining this with established technical indicators, we aim to develop a more robust and accurate prediction model for the CSE.

Our project focuses on two key predictions:

*   **Individual Stock Prices:** Predicting the price movements of specific stocks listed on the CSE.
*   **All Share Price Index (ASPI):** Predicting the overall trend of the CSE market using the ASPI.

## Data

*   **CSE Data:** Historical stock price data obtained from the CSE.
*   **Sinhala News Data:** News articles collected from various Sinhala news sources.

## Methodology

Our prediction model combines two key components:

*   **Technical Analysis:** We utilize various technical indicators, such as moving averages, momentum indicators, and volatility measures, calculated from historical stock price data.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** We perform sentiment analysis on Sinhala news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to capture market sentiment.

These components are then integrated into machine learning models to predict stock prices and the ASPI.
